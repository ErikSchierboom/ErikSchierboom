### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Erik Schierboom, a polyglot developer with a passion for teaching.
I loves learning new programming languages and try to learn one each year.
I've built websites, mobile apps and open-source libraries, mostly in the education space.
In the last 5 years I've worked at Exercism to build the optimal learning experience for 70+ programming languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adding a [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) track to [Exercism](https://exercism.org)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Uiua
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building Exercism's language tracks
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C#, F# or Exercism
